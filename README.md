Friendly Chat allows users to chat and send images in real time.  Instant messaging capabilities, multimedia sharing, and real-time notifications are all supported by a reliable messaging API to handle the complexities of data transmission and user connectivity efficiently.  For every chat sent, current time is also included in the chat box. It also will notify users with notification, but at first, users can choose to allow or block the notification when the web asks for their permission.  This app also features AI generated replies which allow users to chat with AI and not a real user. For a better security enhancement, students can apply reCaptcha to block unauthorized clients and add credentials validation. It also secures the application from unwanted traffic and protects the backend implemented to protect user privacy and data integrity.  The app will incorporate user presence indicators and administrative controls to enhance community management and interaction quality.

For this project, students use AngularFire to develop a real time-messaging web application called Friendly Chat. This app requires students to have a GitHub account, Visual Studio Code and also Node.js downloaded before starting developing this project.  This project aimed to acknowledge students about building a web app using both Google associated softwares which is Angular as the frontend software for a single-page application framework and Firebase as the backend software that serve cloud computing services and application development platform ensuring the development process runs swiftly.  In the beginning of this project, students learn to install both Angular and Firebase by using command prompt in their own laptop and it upskill student ability especially in additional software management.  Students can observe ways to deploy their web app on Firebase during this project, for example, students know how to synchronize data using Cloud Firestore and Cloud Storage also authenticate users in Firebase Authentication.  Moreover, this project builds up skills on the GitHub application for students since this project acquires students to commit and push their coding progress on GitHub.  For the beginners, this project is a step-up from the previous knowledge.  All in all, this project has helped a lot in improving computoring skills for students.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
